 Journal Chapter 5: On Day 189 of the 987th year of the Artemis age, the town of Gandur was attacked by an undead horde, led by resurrected cultist Crassus. The town's residents, guided by a premeditated plan, sought refuge in Vinesnoy's Temple while their militia fought back. The adventurer group known as the Hawks, who had previously saved a resident from Crassus, returned to Gandur just in time to help. They defeated the undead, facilitating the residents' escape and ultimately killing Crassus. In the process, one of the Hawks, Canyea, was killed but subsequently resurrected using a diamond-supplied spell by Priestess Illsuna. However, the town's sheriff, Roland Tress, also died in the battle and could not be resurrected due to a lack of diamonds. Despite heavy losses, Gandur survived the attack, largely thanks to the Hawks' intervention.
