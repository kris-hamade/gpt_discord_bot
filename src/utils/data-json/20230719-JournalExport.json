    "Name": "Baron Torollo Powen",
    "Bio": "A powerful vampire that has been a part of Ortelian politics for almost a century, both publicly and behind the scenes.  Whenever Torollo has been in public for too long, he uses illusion magic and returns as his \"son\".  His current incarnation is \"Quinn\", son of \"Ronik\".A MAN OUT OF TIMEWhen he was first turned into a vampire, Torollo sought to use his powers of undeath to bring fortune to his family.  His wife, Cirella, was horrified at his transformation and staked Torollo through the heart while he slept in his coffin.  Cirella could not bring herself to permanently end her husband, so instead she sealed the crypt and fled.  Torollo remained paralyzed for hundreds of years, unaware of the passage of time.  Eventually, the crypt was unsealed by a curious adventurer and the stake removed.After slaying his rescuer, Torollo found himself as a man out of time.  The betrayal of his wife was fresh in his mind, despite the fact that Cirella had been dead for centuries.  Torollo refocused his rage upon Esteria, blaming the entire world for his situation.A NEW PURPOSEWith his family deceased and his fortune gone, Torollo was determined to reclaim what was lost.  Torollo was smart, and he knew he had an infinite amount of time.Over the next hundred years, Torollo built himself a barony in Ortelia.  He amassed wealth and power, but always wanted more.  He eventually found himself on the Dragon Council, the trusted advisors to the King.  Torollo took his time weaving himself into Ortelian politics.  To avoid suspicion as an immortal that never aged, Torollo used illusion magic to disguise himself as his \"son\" and justifying his position on the Dragon Council as a family legacy.With the ear of the King and a voice in council, Torollo slowly prepared himself to take control.  He amassed an army of followers to do his bidding, using both his political position and supernatural vampiric powers to control his \"troops\".THE PLANTorollo is the secret leader of the Cult of Moloch.  He manipulated the egotistical Maldressa Swain to pull troops from their patrols to allow his cult to move freely.  He pushed for the reinstatement of the Hawks with intentions to make them scapegoats.  The Hawks' actions in Witdel played right into his hands.Using the Hawks' reckless actions as \"proof\" that a military state was the only way to keep the peace, he goaded Maldressa Swain into declaring martial law.  He then resurrected Crassus and sent him to Gandur with a Ring of Moloch that Torollo engraved with the Swain family crest.  This ring became the fake evidence needed to trick the Hawks into following his plan.The people of Ortelia were against the martial law and also in fear of the cult.  With the public opinion of Swain at a tremendous low, Torollo managed to set himself as \"Quinn\" to look like the triumphant hero.  The Hawks were all too eager to help him murder Maldressa, believing she was the cult leader, while also taking the fall for the coup.It is currently unknown why Torollo uses the image of Moloch in his cult.  He may simply be using it as a logo or, as a vampire, he may have actual ties to the Archdevil.Torollo Powen has taken true power in Ortelia.  Now he sets his sights on his neighboring countries."

One day, during a raid on a merchant ship, Canyea's cowardice got the better of him. When the ship's captain confronted him, Canyea panicked and fled.

    "Bio": "Entry from \"Devils, Demons, and the History of the Hells\", 5th edition.MOLOCHMoloch was once an archdevil in the Nine Hells that served as Baalzebul's viceroy in Malbolge before being exiled after the Reckoning. Though formerly the greatest duke of Hell, he was untrusted by his masters and betrayed by his subjects in a devious coup, after which the hated governor plotted his resurgence.As a soldier, Moloch was a dauntless foe that struck fear into the hearts of tanar'ri hordes with just a mention of his Name. He was known for his unending hatred of his opposition and his malice wasn't halted by his rise to power nor tempered by the nature of his victims. Gleefully, he tortured and disfigured other devils in a variety of creative ways with cruelty rivaling that of Baalzebul. Being deposed did nothing to stem his ambition and the prideful devil had no qualms about using deception and confusion to return to power.Entry from \"The promise of Moloch\", author unknown.THE PROMISEIt is known that Moloch desires retribution against Baalzebul for his exile after the Reckoning.  Legend has it that Moloch made a deal in the material plane with a powerful red dragon known as Choreodan.  The details of the deal are lost to time, but the purpose of the deal is believed to be an exchange of power.  Moloch would provide Choreodan with devilish power and in return Choreodan will use his draconic magic to allow Moloch passage into the material plane.  Moloch would easily conquer the material plane and then use the material plane to stage a war against Baalzebul.  With Moloch able to send troops to and from the hells with no fear of retaliation, Moloch's victory would be assured.But time is an abstract concept to an immortal such as Moloch.  In the deal, Moloch did not specify exactly when Choreodan was to fulfill his end of the bargain.  As it came to pass, Choreodan accepted the power and, in his greed, has yet to complete his part of the deal.  Pacts with archdevils are soul binding, and travel beyond time and bloodlines."

    "Name": "Vinesnoy",
    "Bio": "Vinesnoy, sometimes called Lathander, whose title is The\nMorninglord, is a deity of creativity, dawn, renewal, birth, athletics, spring,\nself-perfection, vitality and youth. Vinesnoy is also the god called upon to\nbless birth and fertility related ceremonies. As the god of beginnings, Vinesnoy\ntraditionally receives prayer from many inhabitants of Esteria at the start of\na journey or endeavor. Vinesnoy's Name is invoked to seal alliances and start\nnew ventures or companies. As a result, the god is very popular among the\nmerchant classes.\n\nVinesnoy has a reputation for being sometimes overly enthusiastic, slightly\nvain, and given to excesses, all flaws very common among the young. He is also\neternally optimistic and doggedly perseverant.\n\nSome followers of Vinesnoy insisted that he was in fact the reincarnation of\nAmaunator, the Netherese god of the sun. Others took this heresy further,\nclaiming that he would take up the mantle of the lawful neutral Amaunator\nagain, and that the transformation from deity of the morning to sun god was\nimminent.Worshipers, Clergy & TemplesVinesnoyites seek to build anew, encourage the rebirth of\nbarren areas and more productive growth in cultivated lands, drive out evil,\nand either restore civilization to heights it once had or lead it to new\ndizzying heights of interracial harmony, cooperation, and pursuit of the arts\nand progress. To do this, they battle monsters to nurture civilization; they\nplant seeds and new seedlings, they encourage and aid adventurers, travelers,\ntraders, and pilgrims as the harbingers of culture; and they recover lost\nmagical items, pieces of literature, and works of art. Vinesnoyites study,\nrestore, and attempt to duplicate, emulate, or expand upon these recovered\nitems and works when possible.\n\nTemples and shrines also sponsor athletic events and competitions where people\nof all classes and races can strive together in nonhostile competition in\nwrestling, distance throwing, target archery, running, jumping, horseback\nriding, or any of a number of other noninjurious sports. Other competitions\nsponsored by Vinesnoyian churches are for honors in the literary and fine arts.\nSuch competitions are usually for a prize, which may be money, a special item\nor piece of art, or even a work written about the victor by a famous poet or\nartist. Winning a competition sponsored by the Vinesnoyites brings great status\nin certain circles.\n\nVinesnoyites are expected to make regular offerings of ideas, inventions,\ncoins, discovered artifacts, or food to Vinesnoyian temples and shrines. Much\nmore valuable offerings such as magical items or quantities of gold are demanded\nof nonbelievers in return for special services like rescue missions or raising\nfrom the dead.\n\nVestmentsPriests of Vinesnoy dress in bright long-sleeved robes of\nyellow, red, and pink. These are often called \"sun robes.\" Those\npriests with their own temples have their robes trimmed with ornately crafted\ngold ribbons. A sunburst headpiece, worn toward the back of the head to emulate\na rising sun or radiant sunpeacock, completes the ceremonial garb. The ritual\nrobes used at many rural shrines are simple cassocks with a color scheme by\nrank. Novices and postulants wear brown; adepts and underpriests wear russet\nand crimson. Senior priests wear scarlet, and subpriors and those of higher\nrank wear rose-red. The leader of the temple or shrine wears white. Holy\nsymbols of Vinesnoy are often made of painted wood, cut from rose quartz or\nsimilar minerals, or enchanted to radiate a dim, pink glow.\n\nAdventuring clerics usually wear more utilitarian garb, but prefer reds and\nyellows, to the point of tinting their armor those shades. Most priests of Vinesnoy\nfavor chain mail, and often the only obvious mark of Vinesnoy they bear is a\nrose-red circle on their shields and helm brows.\n\nHierarchyThe Vinesnoyian religion has no overarching hierarchy from\nchurch to church and no central authority. When issues of doctrine or policy\ncome up that must be decided upon, a conference is called at the church who\ninitially presented the problem for consideration, and the issue is resolved.\nRegardless of rank or experience level, each Vinesnoyite priest is considered\nthe master of the temple, shrine, or parish she or he is responsible for no\nmatter the number of priests staffing the facility under him or her.\n\nNovices in the Vinesnoyian faith were called the Awakened, while\nclerics were known as Dawnbringers. The full priests took a new\nName in his service when they were ready to signify that Vinesnoy personally\nrecognized and accepted them. This new Name could either be used instead of\ntheir old Name or simply used only when addressing other Dawnbringers and\nwhen in solitary prayer. Other titles included (in ascending order): Dawngreeter, Dawnlord, High\nDawnlord, and Dawnmaster, while an elite cleric was referred to\nas a Morninglord.\n\nTemplesThe ostentatious cathedrals of Vinesnoy, with their abundant\nstatuary and gaudy stained-glass windows, reflect the order's great wealth. All\ntemples include a mass hall that faces eastward, allowing the congregation to\nwatch the first rays of the rising sun. In crowded or walled cities, temples\nare built for height, with ceremonies held on the third or even fourth floor of\nthe structure. When such construction is impossible, a complex series of\nmirrors channels the sun's rays. Vinesnoyan architecture is dominated by\nelaborate fountains that often spill into shallow moats of holy water winding\nthroughout the temple complex.\n\nTemples and shrines to Vinesnoy provide aid to adventurers and communities in\ntheir area as long as such aid is returned in good faith. Priests of Vinesnoy\ntry tirelessly to encourage those of good alignments to the more dedicated\nworship of the Morninglord if they are not already Vinesnoyites, but they do\nnot insist on conversions or withhold aid if they are refused.\n\nRitualsAs may be surmised, most ceremonies of Vinesnoy are held at\ndawn. Actions taken and contracts agreed to at dawn are considered blessed by\nthe god. Marriages held at Vinesnoyian temples or shrines at dawn are\nconsidered especially blessed and so dawn is when the church most often holds\nsuch services, even if they are inconvenient for visiting guests. Funerals\nconsist of a solemn, candlelit ceremony called the Going Down. This\nceremony is followed by a wake that lasts until dawn prayers. Funerals are not\nheld for those who are to be raised.\n\nThe most important ceremonies of worship are the daily prayers to Vinesnoy at\ndawn, often held outdoors or where the dawn can be seen. This ritual is\nfollowed in importance by the twilight devotions. Some temples and shrines also\nadd to these two daily ceremonies an optional prayer and song to Vinesnoy at\nhighsun. To these daily devotions are added special prayers said when offerings\nare presented at the altar and when priests call on Vinesnoy for guidance or\naid. These ceremonies are all joyful, but dignified, and usually involve\nprayer, song, and ritual drinking of well water touched by the dawn. On special\noccasions, on Midsummer morning, and on the mornings of the vernal and autumnal\nequinoxes, priests of Vinesnoy perform the Song of Dawn, praising Vinesnoy with\na blend of vocal harmonies and counterharmonies of beautiful complexity.\n\nOrder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe church of Vinesnoy has a knightly orders of paladins,\ncrusaders, and fighters known as the Order of the Aster. Members of\nthis order protect temples and shrines, serve to lead large military groups\nlevied as needed to serve the church, and roam the land seeking to do good in Vinesnoy's\nName and promote his worship. Individual temples and shrines of Vinesnoy do not\nusually maintain standing military forces of substantial size due to their\ncost, although they often retain warriors and members of the Order of\nthe Aster to guard their establishments in numbers that each temple\ndecides are appropriate and affordable."

Warlocks struggle with this evil, especially if it's not their nature. Fiends seek only destruction and will destroy all in their path -- especially those who enter into pacts with them.Fighting that corruption can become all-consuming the longer their pact remains. Warlocks of Zoltar learn to draw life from those who die around them, and this rejuvenation can be addictive. Scholars refer to this bloodlust as The Urge.Like most patrons, breaking a pact with a Fiend has deadly consequences.  Conclusion of the contract typically ends with the soul of the Warlock joining their patron in the lower planes."
