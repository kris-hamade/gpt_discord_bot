He was always more interested in music and storytelling than in the politics and scheming of his kin. When he was old enough, he left his house running away from his mother and family, most notably the spider queen, hoping to make a name for himself as a bard. Under the tutelage of a gnome bard named Nostalgia, Canyea learned how to use his musical talents to influence people, perform comedy, and pick locks, but he was always looking for an opportunity to run away if things got too dangerous. Once he left for fear of attracting the spider queen and her minions to his adopted gnomish family, he joined a pirate gang and became a valuable member of his crew by using his night vision to assault unsuspecting merchant ships under the cover of darkness. Of course, in these situations, Canyea is never afraid because he is under complete control and has an obvious advantage. Like a moth to a flame, any living being is owned by Canyea in darkness. One day, during a raid on a merchant ship, Canyea's cowardice got the better of him. When the ship's captain confronted him, Canyea panicked and fled. He washed ashore on a distant island, where he decided to start a new life as a wandering bard. Despite his cowardice, Canyea is a talented musician and storyteller, he is a gifted tactician and a slippery snake on the battlefield, the same way he slithers into our hearts and minds. He uses his skills to entertain crowds and earn a few coins along the way. But he's always looking over his shoulder, afraid that his past will catch up to him."

At his death, the mysterious glowing amulet he was carrying disintegrated.  Later, when Roland Tress and his militia investigated the pit where Crassus had set up his operation, they found that the corpses of Crassus and all of his cultists had disappeared.

His eyes glowed the same greenish color as his amulet had earlier. Crassus has returned to Gandur, this time seeking revenge.  Crassus' assault on Gandur was brutal, leading to the deaths of several of its citizens including Roland Tress and Canyea (although the latter was resurrected by Illsuna). Thanks to the timely rescue by the Hawks, the damage to the town was minimal.  Crassus was defeated by the Hawks in battle just in front of the old castle in the southern part of town.

As a soldier, Moloch was a dauntless foe that struck fear into the hearts oftanar'rihordes with just a mention of his name. He was known for his unending hatred of his oppositionand his malice wasn't halted by his rise to power nor tempered by the nature of his victims. Gleefully, he tortured and disfigured otherdevilsin a variety of creative ways with cruelty rivaling that ofBaalzebul.Being deposed did nothing to stem his ambition and the prideful devil had no qualms about using deception and confusion to return to power.  Entry from \"The promise of Moloch\", author unknown.  THE PROMISE  It is known that Moloch desires retribution against Baalzebul for his exile after the Reckoning. Legend has it that Moloch made a deal in the material plane with a powerful red dragon known as Choreodan. The details of the deal are lost to time, but the purpose of the deal is believed to be an exchange of power. Moloch would provide Choreodan with devilish power and in return Choreodan will use his draconic magic to allow Moloch passage into the material plane. Moloch would easily conquer the material plane and then use the material plane to stage a war against Baalzebul. With Moloch able to send troops to and from the hells with no fear of retaliation, Moloch's victory would be assured.  But time is an abstract concept to an immortal such as Moloch. In the deal, Moloch did not specify exactly when Choreodan was to fulfill his end of the bargain. As it came to pass, Choreodan accepted the power and, in his greed, has yet to complete his part of the deal. Pacts with archdevils are soul binding, and travel beyond time and bloodlines.   "

    "Name": "Tillus Merrion",
    "Bio": "Tillus Merrion is a proud, blustering Halfling who leads the Witdel Growers and Buyers’ Association. The Association – as it is known – represents the most powerful group in the village, and as its leader Tillus acts as a de facto mayor and head of the council.  In his day job, he oversees the sale of grain, wool and other products outside of the village, negotiating contracts with merchants in nearby cities and managing the shipping. He has a gift for trade and has helped to boost Witdel’s prosperity in a number of small but significant ways. When he isn’t working, Tillus is usually beavering away at various schemes and initiatives around the village.  He has a love for order, neatness and the rule of laws and contracts, and is quietly obsessed with making Witdel clean and well organized. This commitment can occasionally make him forget that many of the figures he moves about on his ledgers represent living, breathing people. This has become especially clear in the recent crisis, where his dread of missing a shipment is leading him to try and sell crops that the people of Witdel may need to eat if they are to avoid starvation. Despite this, he is not a bad person. He desperately loves Witdel and will do anything it takes to see it grow and prosper. If this means making people go hungry in order to maintain their long-term credit rating, so be it."

From a young age, he showed a natural affinity for the arcane, often spending hours studying ancient tomes and experimenting with small spells. Valon's family history is unknown, but he was determined to uncover the truth about his powers.  As he grew older, Valon began to uncover the truth about his powers: they came not from the gods, but from a pact he had made with a powerful demon, unbeknownst to him, in his infancy. The demon, known as Zoltar, had chosen Valon as its warlock and granted him immense power in exchange for his loyalty and service.  Valon was horrified by the revelation and struggled to come to terms with his demonic heritage. But as he served his master, Zoltar, He learned to speak and read Abyssal language which was the language of demons and it was also taught by Zoltar himself. He spent years honing his abilities and learning to control his powers, determined to use them for good and to one day find a way to break his pact with Zoltar.  As he traveled the land, he honed his abilities and learned to control his powers, determined to use them for good and to one day find a way to break his pact with Zoltar.

Despite his noble intentions, Valon could not ignore the darkness that lurked within him. He was plagued by nightmares and visions of Zoltar, who constantly whispered temptations and promises of greater power. Valon knew that one day, he would have to confront the demon and make a final choice: succumb to its corruption, or risk everything to be free of its grasp.  Now Valon walks the lands, using his powers for good, fighting against evil and injustice, always aware that the demon is still lurking, waiting for him to falter. He is known as Valon Dreadmyst, a powerful human warlock with a dark past, but a noble heart, always walking the fine line between light and darkness, and always ready for the inevitable confrontation with his demon master."

    "Name": "Vinesnoy",
    "Bio": "Vinesnoy, sometimes called Lathander, whose title is The Morninglord, is a deity of creativity, dawn, renewal, birth, athletics, spring, self-perfection, vitality and youth. Vinesnoy is also the god called upon to bless birth and fertility related ceremonies. As the god of beginnings, Vinesnoy traditionally receives prayer from many inhabitants of Esteria at the start of a journey or endeavor. Vinesnoy's name is invoked to seal alliances and start new ventures or companies. As a result, the god is very popular among the merchant classes.  Vinesnoy has a reputation for being sometimes overly enthusiastic, slightly vain, and given to excesses, all flaws very common among the young. He is also eternally optimistic and doggedly perseverant.  Some followers of Vinesnoy insisted that he was in fact the reincarnation of Amaunator, the Netherese god of the sun. Others took this heresy further, claiming that he would take up the mantle of the lawful neutral Amaunator again, and that the transformation from deity of the morning to sun god was imminent.  Worshipers, Clergy & Temples  Vinesnoyites seek to build anew, encourage the rebirth of barren areas and more productive growth in cultivated lands, drive out evil, and either restore civilization to heights it once had or lead it to new dizzying heights of interracial harmony, cooperation, and pursuit of the arts and progress. To do this, they battle monsters to nurture civilization; they plant seeds and new seedlings, they encourage and aid adventurers, travelers, traders, and pilgrims as the harbingers of culture; and they recover lost magical items, pieces of literature, and works of art. Vinesnoyites study, restore, and attempt to duplicate, emulate, or expand upon these recovered items and works when possible.  Temples and shrines also sponsor athletic events and competitions where people of all classes and races can strive together in nonhostile competition in wrestling, distance throwing, target archery, running, jumping, horseback riding, or any of a number of other noninjurious sports. Other competitions sponsored by Vinesnoyian churches are for honors in the literary and fine arts. Such competitions are usually for a prize, which may be money, a special item or piece of art, or even a work written about the victor by a famous poet or artist. Winning a competition sponsored by the Vinesnoyites brings great status in certain circles.  Vinesnoyites are expected to make regular offerings of ideas, inventions, coins, discovered artifacts, or food to Vinesnoyian temples and shrines. Much more valuable offerings such as magical items or quantities of gold are demanded of nonbelievers in return for special services like rescue missions or raising from the dead.  Vestments  Priests of Vinesnoy dress in bright long-sleeved robes of yellow, red, and pink. These are often called \"sun robes.\" Those priests with their own temples have their robes trimmed with ornately crafted gold ribbons. A sunburst headpiece, worn toward the back of the head to emulate a rising sun or radiant sunpeacock, completes the ceremonial garb. The ritual robes used at many rural shrines are simple cassocks with a color scheme by rank. Novices and postulants wear brown; adepts and underpriests wear russet and crimson. Senior priests wear scarlet, and subpriors and those of higher rank wear rose-red. The leader of the temple or shrine wears white. Holy symbols of Vinesnoy are often made of painted wood, cut from rose quartz or similar minerals, or enchanted to radiate a dim, pink glow.  Adventuring clerics usually wear more utilitarian garb, but prefer reds and yellows, to the point of tinting their armor those shades. Most priests of Vinesnoy favor chain mail, and often the only obvious mark of Vinesnoy they bear is a rose-red circle on their shields and helm brows.  Hierarchy  The Vinesnoyian religion has no overarching hierarchy from church to church and no central authority. When issues of doctrine or policy come up that must be decided upon, a conference is called at the church who initially presented the problem for consideration, and the issue is resolved. Regardless of rank or experience level, each Vinesnoyite priest is considered the master of the temple, shrine, or parish she or he is responsible for no matter the number of priests staffing the facility under him or her.  Novices in the Vinesnoyian faith were called theAwakened, while clerics were known asDawnbringers. The full priests took a new name in his service when they were ready to signify that Vinesnoy personally recognized and accepted them. This new name could either be used instead of their old name or simply used only when addressing otherDawnbringersand when in solitary prayer. Other titles included (in ascending order):Dawngreeter,Dawnlord,High Dawnlord, andDawnmaster, while an elite cleric was referred to as aMorninglord. Temples  The ostentatious cathedrals of Vinesnoy, with their abundant statuary and gaudy stained-glass windows, reflect the order's great wealth. All temples include a mass hall that faces eastward, allowing the congregation to watch the first rays of the rising sun. In crowded or walled cities, temples are built for height, with ceremonies held on the third or even fourth floor of the structure. When such construction is impossible, a complex series of mirrors channels the sun's rays. Vinesnoyan architecture is dominated by elaborate fountains that often spill into shallow moats of holy water winding throughout the temple complex.  Temples and shrines to Vinesnoy provide aid to adventurers and communities in their area as long as such aid is returned in good faith. Priests of Vinesnoy try tirelessly to encourage those of good alignments to the more dedicated worship of the Morninglord if they are not already Vinesnoyites, but they do not insist on conversions or withhold aid if they are refused.  Rituals  As may be surmised, most ceremonies of Vinesnoy are held at dawn. Actions taken and contracts agreed to at dawn are considered blessed by the god. Marriages held at Vinesnoyian temples or shrines at dawn are considered especially blessed and so dawn is when the church most often holds such services, even if they are inconvenient for visiting guests. Funerals consist of a solemn, candlelit ceremony called theGoing Down. This ceremony is followed by a wake that lasts until dawn prayers. Funerals are not held for those who are to be raised.  The most important ceremonies of worship are the daily prayers to Vinesnoy at dawn, often held outdoors or where the dawn can be seen. This ritual is followed in importance by the twilight devotions. Some temples and shrines also add to these two daily ceremonies an optional prayer and song to Vinesnoy at highsun. To these daily devotions are added special prayers said when offerings are presented at the altar and when priests call on Vinesnoy for guidance or aid. These ceremonies are all joyful, but dignified, and usually involve prayer, song, and ritual drinking of well water touched by the dawn. On special occasions, on Midsummer morning, and on the mornings of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, priests of Vinesnoy perform the Song of Dawn, praising Vinesnoy with a blend of vocal harmonies and counterharmonies of beautiful complexity.  Order  The church of Vinesnoy has a knightly orders of paladins, crusaders, and fighters known as theOrder of the Aster. Members of this order protect temples and shrines, serve to lead large military groups levied as needed to serve the church, and roam the land seeking to do good in Vinesnoy's name and promote his worship. Individual temples and shrines of Vinesnoy do not usually maintain standing military forces of substantial size due to their cost, although they often retain warriors and members of theOrder of the Asterto guard their establishments in numbers that each temple decides are appropriate and affordable."

    "Name": "Zoltar, The Fiend",
    "Bio": "Making a pact with a Fiend from the lower planes such as Zoltar is dangerous because all fiends have evil intentions. Warlocks strugglewith this evil, especially if it's not their nature. Fiends seek only destruction and will destroy all in their path -- especially those who enter into pacts with them.  Fighting that corruption can become all-consuming the longer their pact remains. Warlocks of Zoltar learn to draw life from those who die around them, and this rejuvenation can be addictive. Scholars refer to this bloodlust as The Urge.  Like most patrons, breaking a pact with a Fiend has deadly consequences. Conclusion of the contract typically ends with the soul of the Warlock joining their patron in the lower planes."
