    "Name": "Archeological Report - Ironrock",
    "Bio": "Archeological Survey and Report To: Triumvirate of Kes (Keacyne A., Ithuun E., Blasttip M.) Authors: Sternkith B., Scalecracker I. It is the judgement of these researchers that the tomb unearthed beneath the town of Ironrock, Ortelia on the 168th day of this year is in factual certainty the tomb of Amten, Amenmeseshikusas, and Amerys. According to legend, these three brothers were cast out of the region now known today as the northern Eracian Empire and forced to travel westward. It is the findings of these researchers that the three brothers eventually settled in what is now known today as Ironrock. The purpose for this settlement is unknown. The legend as recorded details the attempts of Amten to create an army of undead soldiers. It is the belief of these researchers that their attempts continued into undeath. At some point, the tomb was discovered and resealed as all mentions of the brother's names were removed from any hieroglyphics. The threat ofAmten, Amenmeseshikusas, and Amerys is currently resolved. Adventurers, including one of the authors of this report, slew all three brothers in their mummified forms before they could escape their tomb. All three are beyond restoration. These researchers recommend that the tomb be marked for further investigation by Kes adepts."

    "Name": "Dabbledob's Journal",
    "Bio": "(The journal starts with several pages of scribbling. Formulas half-completed and scratched through. Calculations run along the margins in a jumble of symbols that you may never figure out. Eventually, you find a page written in common.) Eureka! I've done it. My automatic tidiness spell works! By giving the books in the library the smallest hint of animation, they can return to their proper places on the shelves. Automatically! This will revolutionize library cleanliness protocols for all of Ortesia! All I have to do is find a way to cast the spell so that it covers the entire library. (The next dozen pages contain more scribblings, including diagrams of the library and the surrounding area of Vesucan. Eventually, you find another passage written in common.) What a stroke of luck! My research indicates that this very library was built on top of a magical leyline. I should be able to construct a device to channel that leyline energy into my tidiness spell to increase its magnitude by a factor of at least six. I'll have to build the device on the second floor so that the effect trickles down into the library properly. I was visited by the mayor today, and her gnome assistant accidently knocked over the goblet of wine I was drinking to the floor. To our surprise, the books I had already enchanted cleaned the mess! One of them held a mop in its pages like a canine would in its jaws. What a remarkable development! The books didn't stop until the floor was utterly pristine. Poor Ms. Amastacia almost slipped on the shiney floor! I eventually had to temporarily deactivate the device to get the books to stop. (The journal falls back into technical information once again. Included are a series of schematics for a device designed to channel leyline energy. Inside are complete instructions to activate and deactivate the device, and any member of your party should be able to easily follow them. There is one final page written in common.) Ms. Amastacia was concerned about security. It stands to reason that once my discovery goes public, various ne'er-do-wells may attempt to steal my formula. I'll simply modify the spell and use it to activate The Caretaker this afternoon. Grimron said I'd never get it working, but he didn't know I had an entire leyline's worth of energy to channel! I must remember to invite him to the grand opening, just to see the look on his face."

    "Name": "Dabbledob's Weapon Schematic",
    "Bio": "These schematics were found hidden in the cover of Dabbledob's journal. Originally missed by the Hawks but later discovered by Virra Bafflestone.   The plans appear to be for a prototype cannon designed to be mounted onto a mechanical construct utilizing both physical and magical components. The design is compact and should be reasonably attachable to any humanoid construct. The plans also include a compartment for an appendage to be swapped out with the cannon.   These plans are considerably complex and can only be understood by a master in mechanical automaton construction. "

    "Name": "Decree of Martial Law",
    "Bio": "My fellow Ortelians, it is with great reverence and the utmost humbleness that I accept your designation as the new sovereign monarch of Ortelia. As your Queen, I shall do everything in my considerable power to protect these lands and usher a new era of prosperity for all of Ortelia. My father, Timothy Swain, fought in the Eracian Expansion so many years ago. He gave his life defending our lands against the Eracians, and I have been forced to watch for many years as those same races that made up the Eracian ranks that took my father from me escape justice. Even now, there is evidence of a cult brewing within our borders, no doubt created by and rostered by these very same undesirable races. The former King Orley failed to protect you. The Hawks guild failed to protect you. Ortelia failed to protect you, just as it did during the Expansion. No more. Our troops have already been assigned to bolster our borders from any future transgressions. As my first official act as Queen of Ortelia onDay 181 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis, I am declaring martial law in Ortelia. Effective immediately, all nonessential travel to the capital of Ortis is suspended.  Effective immediately, all borders of Ortelia are closed to other nations.  Effective immediately, one garrison of troops in each province of Ortelia will act as law enforcement, with the commander of each division having total authority in judicial matters as my representative.  Effective immediately, for suspicion of Eracian involvement all nonindigenous races in Ortelia are confined to their current town of residence unless authorized by my representative. This includes all non-Human, non-Elf, non-Dwarf, and non-Halfing races. Sub-races, such as Duergar and Drow, are also included.  Furthermore, all races described above shall pay a residency tax of 5 gold pieces a month as the just and due reparation to Ortelia. Failure to pay this tax shall result in the deportation of the violating party as deemed fit by the local garrison's commander.   Hard times are in our future, my dearest subjects, but together we can weather the storm that has been brewing for decades and finally cleanse our nation of the filth brought to us from Eracia.  - Queen Maldressa Swain"

    "Bio": "You're not sure when this journal page appeared in your inventory. It feels as if it has always been there. The script is written in common and, somehow, you recognize the handwriting of the gnome Havvish. Day 107 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis Today was a hell of a day. Here I am trying to figure out how I'm going to rebuild the Hawks in Gandur, when four...count 'em, FOUR...wanna be adventurers show up at the door. I don't have time to babysit another batch of suicidal adventurers. Or so I thought. Gloria kept harassin' me to greet the newcomers, and I left 'em sitting there a good while. Gotta make an impression. So, I go out there expecting to see the usual band of dwarves n' elves n' humans, and what do I get? Well, one human. But also a dark elf, a dragonling thing, and a Gods damn robot. Gloria has got to start screening these adventurers. Anyway, rules is rules, and I'm not gonna turn away four hunks of cannon fodder. As required, I officially inducted them into the Hawks. I'll ask Gloria to send the paperwork to Ortis later, but she probably already did it. The only job I had was a request from the town sheriff, Roland Something, to find his little lost merchant. My pappy fought the Eracians and I'm stuck sending goons off to hunt down deliveries of wool! Anyway, I sent those four knuckleheads...Gods damn robot too....on their way to deal with it. Day 108 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis. Well ho-ly shit. Those adventurers not only found the merchant, but they uncovered a cult right under our noses. In our freaking backyards. So they say. Turns out when the sheriff investigated, he found a bunch of dead goblins and the rest of Olly's caravan, but no cultists. Olly swears up and down that the cultists were there. They didn't just get up and walk off. Did they? Anyway, I'm going to have to give those adventurers some respect. They managed to turn a milk run into disaster and lived to tell the tale. Maybe I can trust them to handle some business outside of Gandur. It's a big Kingdom out there after all! When they get back, I'll see if they can handle that situation in Witdel that Olly mentioned."

    "Bio": "You're not sure when this journal page appeared in your inventory. It feels as if it has always been there. The script is written in common and, somehow, you recognize the handwriting of Father Johan Merriksonn. Day 112 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis It has been almost 2 months since my dear brother Alexi disappeared. Since that time, the wolves in the woods outside of Witdel have become more aggressive. They're taking sheep right out from under our noses. Livestock disappearing from locked paddocks and shepherds hearing strange sounds at night. I wonder if Alexi's protection all these years were the only thing keeping these wolves away. May Vinesnoy watch over us. Day 113 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis. The town's economy is starting to hurt. Tillus is irate. I know he only wants the best for Witdel, but he is blinded by the numbers. He isn't considering the toll on the people. A group of the young ones went into the forest last night. They returned clawed to ribbons. We thought young Willen was killed, but he later showed up on the Meyer's doorstep. Poor lad is delirious, talking about hearing voices in the night. Day 115 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis. Tillus finally agreed to send for hired help. The town coffers can afford a hit if it means these wolf attacks stop. I sent a messenger to Gandur. I'm told the Hawks have established a guildhall in that town. I pray the adventurers arrive quickly. Perhaps they will be able to bring me some peace about my brother. Day 117 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis. The adventurers arrived late in the evening while I was in council. We heard them enter, loudly and obnoxiously. They managed to anger dear Leanor something fierce. It took me hours to finally calm her down afterwards. The group did not endear themselves to the citizens of Witdel at all. The dark elf accused Leanor of dealing in illegal goods and the human attempted to haggle with Tillus about their payment, despite having achieved nothing! I am beginning to wonder if Tillus was right all along. I directed them to Alexi's home as a starting point, but they decided to retire for the evening. I hope tomorrow brings them success. Day 118 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis. Today is a dark day for Witdel. A halfling arrived early in the morning from the capital, name of Polo Humblegrain. He said he was a magical researcher that had been in contact with Alexi. I directed him to the Alexi's house just as I had the adventurers. Polo was eager to find out what happened to Alexi and left before the adventurers even awoke for the day. If I had known it would be the last time I would see him alive, I never would have let him leave. The Wilson's boy came into town later that day, saying that he saw the adventurers carrying Polo into the woods. Some of the young lads followed the adventurer's trail into the woods, where they found... I cannot bring myself to record what they found, for I dare not dwell on it. Polo Humblegrain was dead, executed I'm sure by those same adventurers that we hired. Vinesnoy help us...we did not know. We could not have known the horrors those adventurers would bring. The adventurers returned later, covered in blood and reeking of the stench of death. They claimed the wolves were sentient and wanted us to strike a deal with the town. But what of my brother? The adventurers knew nothing. They even lied to my face about Polo. Tillus was furious, of course. Corel believed their story, and eventually so did the rest of the council. Disgusting. But alas, Corel insisted we pay the adventurers the agreed upon reward since they did technically present us with a solution to the wolf problem. But my brother is still missing. I have no answers. I have no closure. Now I worry I never will. The closest thing to satisfaction I received this day was watching the adventurers taken away in irons. Arrested for the murder of Polo Humblegrain. They even found poor Polo's...head...stuffed away in the warforged's bag like a trophy. The Hawks are horrible people. I pray that Vinesnoy guides the hands of justice swiftly. Day 119 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis Corel has returned from meeting these wolves. Apparently they are led by a huge blue wolf named \"Bolt.\" The wolves claim that a man disappeared in a flash of light, and that caused their new intelligence. I will always wonder if this could have been Alexi, but due to the Hawks incompetence I will never know. I still do not believe all of it, but Corel insists that a path to peace has been found. I am troubled that a town such as ours can be both aided and devastated by the Hawks. I have heard that an inquisitor from Ortelia has been summoned to judge the Hawks. May Vinesnoy's light shine upon this land."

Bless his heart. He's brilliant but often so blind to things that are obvious. Like my affections! Ms. Amastacia and I tried to enter the library, but those books are out of control! One of them fired some kind of blueish beam at us! Whatever magic is powering those books has made them aggressive. I hope Dabbledob will be safe!

Day 145 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis The adventurers are still not here yet.

Ms. Amastacia is convinced that this library is going to rejuvenate the town. We've lost so much tourism and business the last few years. I trust Ms. Amastacia knows what she's doing, but this Library will need to be a HUGE success if we're to stay in the green in our ledgers.  Day 148 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis  The Hawks finally arrived today. I know the road from Gandur is long, but poor Dabbledob has been trapped in that Library for over a week! They met with Ms. Amastacia and agreed to help! Those kind selfless souls didn't even ask about the reward or payment, they just charged right into that nasty library! It's been an hour. No word yet. Two hours. Oh dear. The adventurers are back! I hope they fixed the problem. I'll be back, Mr. diary, when I've spoken with Dabbledob! (The next page is crinkled, as if the page was wet and later dried.) No no no no why no poor dabbledob is gone why why didnt I do something earlier No. No. Remain strong, Virra. You have to help Ms. Amastacia. You have to help Vesucan. Bless those adventurers, I'm sure they did their best. It was foolish to hold out hope after a week. I'll need to visit the temple of Vinesnoy this week. I have a lot ot talk about. "

The script is written in common and, somehow, you recognize the handwriting of Bheldahr Sternkith. Day 162 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis The news of a necromancy sighting in the Ironrock mines had come across my desk a week earlier. Apparently a dwarven mining operation stumbled into a tomb of some sort, buried long ago most likely. I arrived in Ironrock in the morning. I could smell the filth of undeath as soon as my boots touched ground off the wagon. I proceeded to the mine's foreman and town's mayor, Adnur Lenkin. As a kinsman, I expected Mr. Lenkin to be more accommodating to my demands. Vinesnoy's path is very clear on the undead, and I should have proceeded immediately into the mine to cleanse it.  Mr. Lenkin had other plans. It seems that before my arrival, Mr. Lenkin sent a request for adventurers to this \"Hawks\" guild out of Gandur. He had apparently been waiting almost a month before my arrival and was insistent that I wait for these adventurers to arrive. I hope they arrive soon.  Day 164 of the 987th year of the Age of Artemis I did not have to wait long. The adventurers arrived just a few days after I did. Quite a sorry lot they appear to be. I thought I sensed something from the human when we first met, but I could not be certain. It is likely the proximity of the undead in the mines below my feet have made me jittery. Regardless, the adventurers were obviously not undead and that was good enough for me. Mr. Lenkin explained the situation, and they dove into the mines without any fuss. I admired their bravery, I just hoped it was not foolishness. They were gone three or perhaps four hours, but they returned victorious and successful. Apparently the tomb housed a trio of mummified spellcasters, intent on raising the skeletons and bodies of their former servants. With the mine clear, I am now free to study the architecture of the tomb and determine the cause of this undead uprising. One of the adventurers, a Mr. Ignis Scalecracker, is separating from his group to assist me in my study. I find him a rather engaging intellectual, something I would not have expected from his towering draconic appearance. Vinesnoy teaches that the cycle of renewal creates all manner of creatures, so I am not surprised. Mr. Lenkin seems to have received some troubling news from Louvillefit. Perhaps the rest of Mr. Scalecracker's party can handle the matter while we research this tomb."

    "Bio": "You're not sure when this journal page appeared in your inventory. It feels as if it has always been there. The script is written in common and, somehow, you recognize the handwriting of Olly Coopersmith. Day 189 of the 987th year of the age of Artemis As I write this, I am standing in the forest area outside of Gandur surrounded by my fellow residents. The flames are still burning. We have just received word that the Hawks have ended the threat, and I shall endeavor to record what happened here while the memory is still fresh. Months ago, I was lured into a trap by cultists of Moloch, lead by this despicable human named Crassus. I would have surely perished if not for the intervention of a group of adventurers I would come to know as the Hawks. They slew Crassus, the human known as Valon dealing the final blow to end that evil. Or so we thought. I set up shop in Gandur after I recovered, and at the advice of the Hawks I started a jewelcrafting business. The Hawks convinced Gandur's sheriff, Roland Tress, to prepare for a possible cultist attack. It would be almost 80 days until that attack came. When it arrived, it was not a group of men wielding swords as expected, it was a horde of the undead. Zombies! We followed the plan that Roland set up for us. Most of the residents, including myself, were able to reach the safety of Vinesnoy's Temple. Priestess Illsuna used her cleric abilities to hold the undead at bay, but much of the town was overrun by the undead and their cultist handlers. The militia did their best, but many of them fell to the horde. We surely would not have survived if the Hawks had not arrived. They were off adventuring, as they do, and we were most fortunate they arrived on this night! They tore through the undead and made a path out of town for us to escape. Over the last couple of months, I had been collecting diamonds as they came through my shop. As the primary component of resurrection spells, diamonds are exceedingly rare in Ortelia. They've almost been completely used up over the centuries, and it was to be my gift to the Hawks as thanks for saving me from that pit. Instead, I gave the diamonds to Illsuna in hope they will be useful. The priestess joined the Hawks as they ventured deeper into the town. I joined the rest of the survivors in escaping from the village. Jannetty was faithfully at his post just outside the gate, and he directed us to a safe place outside of the village in the woods. There we waited as we watched our homes burn in the distance. A seemingly eternity later, two more survivors joined us. One of them, thankfully, was my friend Roy. The Ratkeys Inn was gone, the first victim of the attack and the logical place to find most of the townsfolk. Those of us not at the inn made it to the temple, but the patrons of the tavern were slaughtered. Roy told me that the Hawks arrived just in time to save his life. Almost 30 minutes later, we got word from Jannetty that the Hawks had defeated the leader of the attack just at the gates of the keep. The leader was Crassus, again! Somehow resurrected as an undead abomination, it was Crassus and his vile cult that drove the zombies to our doorsteps. The Hawks killed him for good this time, with Ignis reducing his body to ash. Some justice for our fallen brethren. One of the Hawks, Canyea, was killed in the battle. Fortunately, Illsuna was able to use the diamonds I gave her to bring him back with magic. Amazing. Unfortunately, I only had enough diamonds to use the spell once. That means there is no hope to bring back Roland Tress, who also lost his life in the battle. It must have been a hard choice for Illsuna to decide who to bring back. She had to know that saving Canyea also condemned Roland. May he rest in peace, our beloved sheriff. The remaining militia are putting out the rest of the fires. Gandur will survive, thanks to the Hawks."
