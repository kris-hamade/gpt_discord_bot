He was captivated by music and storytelling and eventually left his family to pursue the life of a bard. Under the guidance of a gnome bard named Nostalgia, Canyea honed his musical talents, learned to influence people, perform comedy, and pick locks. However, he's always kept an eye out for a chance to flee from danger.\n\nCanyea joined a pirate gang and proved valuable to the crew by using his night vision to assault unsuspecting merchant ships under cover of darkness. He once showed cowardice on a raid and ended up washing ashore on a distant island, where he decided to build a new life as a wandering bard.\n\nCanyea is a talented musician, storyteller, and tactician on the battlefield, using his bardic abilities to entertain crowds and earn some coins. However, he's always vigilant, fearing that his past may catch up to him.",
