They have a long history of serving in political roles and have held powerful positions such as barons and council members. Recently, Maldressa Swain has been a major player in Ortelian politics, and is now the Queen of Ortelia with a controversial decree of martial law. There have also been dark events surrounding the Swain family, such as the undead cult leader Crassus wearing a ring with their family crest and the disappearance of the corpses of Crassus and his cultists.",
